<p style="font-size:150%"> So I've Never really thought about making a web page just about myself. but then I've always wanted to. Currently I'm in my third year of engineering at NITK, Surathkal , India. We have a course this year which is supposed to get us familiar with the practicality of web technology and this is a direct result of the first Lab. So let me get started.

<h2> Interests , Hobbies and Passion </h2>

<p style="font-size:150%">I love Music.My music interest took a turn in my first year of college. The Sony Music app on my first Xperia phone introduced me to new music which would very soon turn out to become my favorite genre. The band was named Karnivool and the first song I heard was 'We Are'. stumbling upon that one song totally changed my taste. it was as if I had found my calling. 
ever since then I have found some really great bands in the progressive genre like Tool,DLC, APC etc. Here is a song named Umbra from the album "Sound Awake" by Karnivool. </p>
